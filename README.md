#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Definition of Prompt Engineering: Prompt engineering involves crafting inputs (prompts) to guide AI models toward generating the desired output. It is essential for optimizing interactions with AI, as the effectiveness of the output can significantly depend on the clarity and specificity of the input.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of a Vague Prompt:
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about technology."
Improved Prompt: "Explain the impact of artificial intelligence on healthcare, focusing on its benefits and challenges."
Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective: The improved prompt is clearer, more specific, and directly outlines the desired focus areas (benefits and challenges) within a specific context (healthcare). This allows the AI to generate a more relevant and detailed response, reducing ambiguity and enhancing the quality of the interaction.
